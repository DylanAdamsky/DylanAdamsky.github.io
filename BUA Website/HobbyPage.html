		Every summer I go back home and work at a Seafood restaurant. I cook things like Talapia, Grilled Salmon, Mahi Mahi, etc.. I have a pool table at my house and I find myself playing myself in solids vs. stripes for upwards of 3 hours a day. I love women. I am an avid chess player, and I have competed in tournaments placing at 4th place. I was also on the Wrestling team in high school and I hope to wrestle for the UMaine team.
