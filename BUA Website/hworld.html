		Welcome to my web site! My name is Dylan Henry Adamsky, and I am a second year Business student. I hope to major in Business Management, with a minor in Statistics. I am an Eagle Scout and I achieved the rank when I was just fourteen years old. I grew up in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. I moved to Wells, Maine, my freshman year of high school. I have always wanted to go to the University of Maine, and now I am in a Fraternity here on campus!
		Go Blackbears!
